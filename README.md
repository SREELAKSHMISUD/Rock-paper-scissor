# Rock-paper-scissor
Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
## Description
This Python script implements the classic game of rock, paper, scissors. It allows the user to choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and then compares their choice with a random choice made by the computer. The game then determines the winner based on the traditional rules:

Rock crushes Scissors
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
The program displays the user's choice, the computer's choice, and announces the outcome (win, lose, or draw) based on the comparison of choices.
### Code Images 
I have used ASCII art for images. You can check cool arts from this webpage and make cool codes and games.

## Usage
Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
Enter your choice when prompted (0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, 2 for Scissors).
The program will display the choices made by both you and the computer, and announce the result (win, lose, or draw).
